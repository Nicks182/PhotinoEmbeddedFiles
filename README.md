# PhotinoEmbeddedFiles
Showing how to use Photino with Embedded files to create a single exe

Using [Photino_io](https://www.tryphotino.io)https://www.tryphotino.io/ allows us to create cross platform desktop applications using HTML, javascript, and CSS with C# as your backend.

This little project shows how to embed the html, script, css, and other asset files so you can produce a single exe. This way your assets won't be easily accessible inside the application directory and users can’t edit them.

To bundle your files you can use something like: [BundlerMinifier](https://github.com/madskristensen/BundlerMinifier)

I’m currently using a more up to date version: [BundlerMinifierPlus](https://github.com/salarcode/BundlerMinifierPlus)
