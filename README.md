# PhotinoEmbeddedFiles
Showing how to use Photino with Embedded files to create a single exe

Using [Photino.io](https://www.tryphotino.io/) allows us to create cross platform desktop applications using HTML, javascript, and CSS with C# as your backend.

This little project shows how to embed the html, script, css, and other asset files so you can produce a single exe. This way your assets won't be easily accessible inside the application directory and users canâ€™t edit them.
